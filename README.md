# Oozie tasks manual

#L0,L1,L2.1,L2.2,L3 - folders with tasks

# Report screenshots are located in target folder: L0 in L0, etc.

#L2.2 comments - almost done, but encountered unknown error, perhaps need to pass sql query with file

#L3 - L3 bundles success - compilation took more than hour, so on the L3 bundles it's still running on 54% (too many jobs and hue too slow)
#All other L3 100% success - workflows, jobs.
